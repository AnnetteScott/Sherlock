The chances of Lincoln being killed in the manner described by the Hibberts ls so remote that I firstly considered the alternatives. The obvious choice is the Aboriginal servant. If a throw from him had killed Lincoln however, there would be no reason for him to disappear; the story as related by the brothers would exonerate him. My reconstruction of the events is therefore as follows. 'The brothers had planned to kill Lincoln in the belief that his fortune would devolve to their mother, and thereafter to themselves. Suggesting that the three of them only visited the Park at such an early hour would ensure no witnesses. This would explain the illogicality of leaving behind the most expert boomerang thrower, the Aboriginal, when it would be surely natural to use him for instruction purposes. 'Whilst Gerald held Lincoln's attention, Thomas delivered the coup de grace to the back of the neck, using the boomerang as the classical 'blunt instrument' and not as a throwing weapon. 'Unfortunately, this scene was witnessed by the servant, whose native instinct had led him to follow the party at a distance. Arriving too late on the scene to prevent his master's demise, the unfortunate fellow was dispatched in like manner. Two bodies however, could not so easily be explained, and so disposal of the Aboriginal's body was required. His disappearance would also cause the police to disperse their resources attempting to locate his whereabouts rather than concentrating their attention on the Hibberts themselves. 'Then where is this body?' asked Lestrade tetchily. 'I believe it will be found in a shallow grave in the undergrowth surrounding the open area where the murder took place,' replied Holmes. 'There would be no time for the brothers to make a more satisfactory disposal of the body. This would account for the traces of dried earth on the uppers of both Hibberts shoes, and also the dulling and scratch marks on the blades of the boomerangs, which were undoubtedly pressed into service as rudimentary digging tools.' 'Magnificent Holmes,' applauded Watson. 'Elementary,' corrected Holmes.",

Deducing from the position of Miss Sharp's body when it was found and the nature of the blow to the head, that the killer had gained legitimate access to her premises, Holmes established in his own mind that the killer must have been well known to Miss Sharp. Given the weight of the blow which killed Miss Sharp, Holmes was able to rule out the small circle of female acquaintances from his list of suspects. This left Sir Percival himself. Observing the possible link through his club with Moriarty, Holmes took particular note of Sir Percival's changed appearance and behaviour. The suspicion that Moriarty had replaced the unfortunate police commissioner with one of his own disciples was finally confirmed by Sir Percival's obvious discomfort in a well-worn pair of shoes.

Secondly, he arranged the dead mice to lay a false trail and make the police think it was a ritual killing. Thirdly, he took the notebook, wrote in a reference to the nursery rhyme, deposited it at the bank and handed the key and clock from his living room into the pawnbroker.

		"message": "'A simple case once you assume that your three murders were indeed linked. We were looking for a person bearing a grudge against a judge, a prison governor and a married woman, and who has the ability to harness the strange creature known as the Gila monster. Given that Mr Barton's recollection of names is unlikely to be entirely accurate, I could not determine which of your suspects we were dealing with, until verification arrived from two separate sources. Fitzroy is, of course, Norman French for King's son and this name stood out on the passenger list of the only vessel to have docked from Mexico. Furthermore, the man was clearly accustomed to handling animals as confirmed by the landlord of the Boar's Head. Our quarry therefore, is Naughton Fitzroy but what after all these years had led him to embark upon this terrible course of revenge, and how have the murders been achieved? I am sure that his return has been planned over many years and that the strange way in which his revenge has been taken signifies the extent to which an intelligent mind has been warped. As to his method, I am convinced that the Gila monster has been responsible for all three deaths. Introduced in the case of George Bellairs through the narrow opening which the window afforded and no doubt restrained by lead, the creature went straight for the unsuspecting victim whose death followed. In the case of Mrs Barton, the introduction of the reptile to the theatre box was again achieved swiftly and silently.' 'And Sir Percival?' enquired Lestrade. 'No traces of poison in his body, Mr Holmes.' 'He died from shock. I am sure that the creature was introduced to the cab prior to Sir Percival's entrance, as it would be easy for Fitzroy to establish his routine. The creature would remain dormant in the darkness and only the motion of the carriage and the faint light from gas mantles along the way would cause it to be aroused. Can you imagine the effect that its presence would have on an old man? We know what it did to the cab driver, a man of clear conscience and robust health!' 'So there we have it Lestrade, but advise your men to tread cautiously, for this man and his beast have a formidable capacity for the destruction of human life!'",

		"message": "'Well Lestrade, the end result has been as I feared. It is possible to follow but difficult to anticipate the movements of a man whose mental processes have become as erratic as Fitzroy's have. However, this case may teach me not to rest when the immediate objective has been achieved but to follow through to the final conclusion.' 'What put you onto Duffy as the next victim?' asked Lestrade. 'It was clear that Fitzroy was bent on destroying those people against who he felt a personal sense of injustice. The man was obviously driven by a powerful motive. What more powerful motive than the fact that he was truly innocent? Accept this fact and then ask which person would have the most to gain from the twin acts of burning down a joint property (which was quite reasonably insured) whilst ensuring that Fitzroy paid for the crime? Both Barton and Fatt were indeed potential targets but with time at a premium, I had to presume that Duffy would be the victim.' 'But why overweight? And what about the method he would use?' 'How could anybody go through life with the name Pelham Duffy and avoid being known popularly as Plum Duff? As for the method, poison was clearly the intended choice for all his victims. With the Gila monster dead, it was logical to assume that a snake of some sort, and a rattlesnake in all probability, would be employed. Hence my alertness when we entered Duffy's room.' 'Yes, glad to have you with me, Mr Holmes. And now if you will excuse me, I must leave to make my report.' A wry smile played around Holmes' lips as the policeman disappeared. Would any record of his own activities appear in that report!? Victim: The next victim was Pelham Duffy, Fitzroy's ex-partner; Method: Poisoned by rattlesnake, location for the murder: In his own rooms; When Fitzroy intends to strike: The same day.",

		"message": "'This leaves a nasty taste in the mouth, Watson, and I am glad to be done with it. The sudden appearance of the girl, the strained relationships between Darnley Adams and his wife, the regular payments, all lead me to conclude that the girl has some sort of hold over Adams. The old photograph, the faded signature and the facial resemblance which you pointed out Watson, leave me without doubt that Adams and Alice Jones were father and daughter, the result of an injudicious relationship formed in Adams' young days. I do not doubt that he supported both mother and daughter but when her mother died, Alice Jones was determined to make some capital out of her father's guilty secret. A personal situation in her father's own household indeed put her into a powerful situation. Yet her very presence and continuing demands proved too much for the man. Last night proved the final straw. After Riley went to bed, Alice accosted Adams in his study, no doubt to demand more money. Adams lost his temper and as she lay there he added cold calculation to his act of blind fury. He tore down the curtain cord and finished the girl off. A hurried attempt to suggest a burglary was hardly worth the effort, although perhaps Adams was unlucky to have Justice Riley suggest that use be made of my services.' 'Let us leave Watson, as soon as we have told Lestrade.' How: The victim was struck by a chess piece and then strangled; Who: The killer was Darnley Adams and Why: Alice Jones was his illegitimate daughter and was blackmailing him.",
